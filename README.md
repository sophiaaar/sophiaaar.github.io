## About me

Physics student turned game developer. My passions include creating personal experiences in games, and encouraging others to do the same.

I work for [Unity Technologies](http://unity3d.com/) as a Software Development Engineer in Test.

Outside of work, I make [short games](https://sophiaaar.itch.io/), organise events for girls to learn game development, and mentor at Coder Dojo.

## Work

My first games industry job was working as a QA Tester on APB Reloaded, the 3rd person shooter MMO. Working at a small studio allowed me to explore a number of disciplines before getting promoted to Software Engineer. I eventually took up a technical support role at Unity, where I realised my love of troubleshooting and helping others create the best projects they can. Now in the Release QA team, I ensure that Unity users get the best possible product.
