## About me

Software engineer with a focus on game engines, tooling, and automation. My passions include creating personal experiences in games, and encouraging others to do the same.

I work for [modl.ai](http://modl.ai/) as a Senior Software Engineer. Previously, I was at Unity Technologies for 6 years.

Outside of work, I make [short games](https://sophiaaar.itch.io/), organise events for girls to learn game development, and mentor at Coder Dojo.

In 2018, I was honoured to be featured on the [GamesIndustry.biz 100](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/top100/2018). I also had a [game featured](https://sophiaaar.itch.io/be-young-and-shut-up) at AMaze Berlin as part of the Out Of The Frame game jam.
