## About me

Physics student turned game developer. My passions include creating personal experiences in games, and encouraging others to do the same.

I work for [Unity Technologies](http://unity3d.com/) as a Software Engineer.

Outside of work, I make [short games](https://sophiaaar.itch.io/), organise events for girls to learn game development, and mentor at Coder Dojo.

In 2018, I was honoured to be featured on the [GamesIndustry.biz 100](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/top100/2018). I also had a [game featured](https://sophiaaar.itch.io/be-young-and-shut-up) at AMaze Berlin as part of the Out Of The Frame game jam.

## Work

My first games industry job was working as a QA Tester on APB Reloaded, the 3rd person shooter MMO. Working at a small studio allowed me to explore a number of disciplines before getting promoted to Software Engineer. I eventually took up a technical support role at Unity, where I realised my love of troubleshooting and helping others create the best projects they can. Now in the Release QA team, I ensure that Unity users get the best possible product.
